x84 - family of processors 
ARM - phones
AVR - microcontrollers
each of arhitectures supports own set of commands

-------------------------------
8086-80286   | 16bit  | 
80386        | 32 bit | x86 starts here
AMD64==EM64T | 64 bit | x86-64 
-------------------------------
AMD developed full back capability x86-64 arhictecure for
supporting 64 bits processor. intel bought a licence and 
changed it a little bit 
AMD 64 architecture = AMD64
Intel 64 arhitecture =  EM64T
(for high capability servers systems they use Intel's own arhitecutre AI64)

razrjadnost - maximum amount of bit processor can process


register size should be KRATEN for RAM size

AL=8bit    | 8
AH=8bit    | 8
AX=AL+AH   | 16
EAX=16+AX  | x86
RAX=32+EAX | x86-64

special registers are:
registers for
 storing memory addresses - ss, cs, ds
registers for stack working - bp, sp (showing frame beginning and top of stack)
flag registers - FLAGS stores result of the operations before
ip - insturction pointer - stores pointer to next command to be executed

opcode|command|instruction
MOV AX, 7;


address translation mechanism
processor can work in many stages

16bit - real  address mode without any protection
32bit - protected mode with addresses translation
64bit - only after protected mode

by documentation AMD and intel declares only 2 mode 
of execution
legacy mode  or ia32 by intel
long mode  or ia32e by intel

processors privelegies mode level
this level represents access allowense
to different processors resourses

16 bit supports only BIOS
there are no need to protect

0 level - OS level, full access to processor
1 level - restrictions from 0
2 level - restrictions from 0, 1
3 level - restrictions from 0, 1, 2
usually only 0 and 3 used

RAM spliited into segments
