Number representation systems 

Any system has some base and every number that should
be represented using some system has a weight
the weight itself decriments by each step from the
left to right side.

Decimal system
Decimal system represents number using 10 base
number 123 in decimal system is 123 (1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10^1)

Binary system
Each number here can be represented as a sequence of bits
123 in binary is 1111011
 
123/2 = 61.* -> has floating -> 1
61/2  = 30.* -> has floating -> 1
30/2  = 15.0 -> doesnt       -> 0
15/2  = 7.*  -> has floating -> 1
7/2   = 3.*  -> has floating -> 1
3/2   = 1.*  -> has floating -> 1
1/2   = 0.*  -> has floating -> 1

1101111 -> reverse -> 1111011

To convert back from binary to decimal:
take binary itself 1111011
assign weights
w| 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
n| 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0
  64  +  32   +   16  +   8   +   0   +   2   +   1
-> 123
