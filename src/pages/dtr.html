        <br> Data Transfer Rate
        <br> it is a term that describes how many data can be 
        <br> transfered from source to destination device
        <br> for example, from HDD to USB
        <br>
        <br> We also should understand measurments used for DTR
        <br> and they are:
        <br>  1) Bits  per second bps (Mega/Giga bps or Mbps/Gbps)
        <br>  2) Bytes per second Bps (Mega/Giga Bps or MBps/GBps)
        <br> 
        <br> If we are talking about: how to measure HDD DTR
        <br> or what is hard disk drive data transfer rate,
        <br> it is: sectors in each track * amount of heads
        <br> DTR usually is used to measure the DTT which is 
        <br> data transfer time or otherwise - access time

        <br> 
        <br> The average transfer rate considering in HDD context is  100 MBpsâ€“200 MBps
