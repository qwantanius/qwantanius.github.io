<br> ---------(Q:51:1)
<br> if the memory cell whose address is 5 contains the value 8, 
<br> what is the difference between writing the value 5 into 
<br> cell number 6 and moving the contents of cell number 5 into cell number 6?
<br> when we moving a content from cell 5 to 6, the value of 
<br> ANSWER:
<br> cell number 6 will be 8, as 8 is a content of cell number 5 
<br> BUT, when we write NUMBER 5 into cell number 6, we just save a number into a CELL
<br> ---------(Q:51:2)
<br> Suppose you want to interchange the values stored in memory
<br> cells 2 and 3. What is wrong with the following sequence of steps:
<br> Step 1. Move the contents of cell number 2 to cell number 3.
<br> Step 2. Move the contents of cell number 3 to cell number 2.
<br> ANSWER:
<br> This implementation will make a data leak - we suppose to defined a TMP cell
<br> for saving interchanged data, here pseudo-code algorithm:
<br> MOVE DATA FROM CELL(2) TO TMP CELL
<br> MOVE DATA FROM CELL(3) TO CELL(2) <- this step was missing
<br> MOVE DATA FROM TMP CELL TO CELL(3)
<br> ---------(Q:51:3)
<br> Design a sequence of steps that correctly interchanges the
<br> contents of these cells. If needed, you may use additional cells.
<br> ANSWER:
<br> see Q:51:2
<br> ---------(Q:51:4)
<br> How many bits would be in the memory of a computer with 4KB memory
<br> ANSWER:
<br> 1KB = 1024 BYTES
<br> 1 BYTE = 8 BITS
<br> => 4 KB = 4*1024*8 = 32768 BITES
