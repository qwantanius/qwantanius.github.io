<br> HDD - hard disk drive 
<br> electro-mechanical (data can be stored and read
<br> within mechanical HDD heads (disk read-n-write heads) 
<br> movements coordinated by HDD controller) 
<br> data storage device (data storage device 
<br> is an unit responsible for storing information)
<br> 
<br>
<br> TRACK
<br> Track its simply a circle made BY ONE disk read and 
<br> write head.  
<br> 
<br>
<br> SECTOR
<br> Part of the track. Why we need it?
<br> Sectors are needed because usually 
<br> sectore provides more room to store 
<br> data than needed amount
<br> SECTOR is a sequence of BITS (e.g.: 010101010)
<br> Another formal explanation: information on tracks is recorded as
<br> continious
<br> ALL SECTORS on the disc should contain the same amount of BIT's
<br> Popular capacities are from 512 bytes to a few KB's
<br> 
<br>
<br> INTER-SECTOR GAPS
<br> Check out brief guide <a href="https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/CS3/html/Glossary.html#term-inter-sector-gap">-></a>
<br> Gap between sectores with no data stored inside them
<br> used for SECTOR's separation
<br>
<br>
<br> CYLINDER
<br> Set of tracks. In HDD there usually 4 r-w heads, 
<br> whenever they spin they create a 4 tracks.
<br> these 4 tracks creates a cylinder.
<br> Whenever position of those heads is changing - different
<br> cylinders starts being accessable
<br> 
<br>
<br> ZBR
<br> Zoned bit recording
<br> method of storing information used by disks to optimize
<br> data capacity within storing storing more data on outer 
<br> than inner tracks
<br> the idea of zonning is that different zones are used for
<br> for different data

<br>
<br>
<br> SEEK TIME
<br> Read-and-write HEAD's of the disk can move HORIZONTALY
<br> from TRACK to TRACK (closer or more far from/to disk center)
<br> SEEK TIME its a time requried to move HEAD from TRACK to TRACK
<br> 
<br>
<br> ROTATIONAL DELAY
<br> waiting time while disk will rotate needed sector under the disk HEAD
<br> rotational delay is measuer in REVOLUTIONS PER MINUTE - RPM
<br> OTHER DEFINITON's:
<br> - Required time for needed data to rotate to positioned HEAD
<br> - HALF of the time needed for one full rotation of disk, which is 
<br>   average time for disered data to rotate around to read/write HEAD
<br>
<br>
<br> ACESS TIME 
<br> Acess time can be simply defined using formula
<br> ACESS TIME = SEEK TIME + ROTATIONAL DELAY
<br> WARNING: some resources tells, that access time 
<br> should also contain DATA TRANSFER TIME
<br> which can be defined as:
<br> TRANSFER TIME = DATA TO BE TRANSFERED / TRANSFER RATE
<br> where TRANSFER RATE = (amount of sectors in each track) * (amount of heads in the disk)
