    <br>
    <br> To convert HEX to BIN as A NATURAL UNSIGNED DECIMAL NUMBER:
    <br> take the HEX NUMBER SYMBOL
    <br> 0xF123
    <br> Separate and convert each symbol to bin:
    <br> F - 1111
    <br> 1 - 0001
    <br> 2 - 0010
    <br> 3 - 0011
    <br> ANSWER: HEX(F123) = BIN(1111 0001 0010 0011)
    <br>
    <br> To convert BIN to HEX
    <br> Devide BINARY number by 4 symbols from right side
    <br> 101001 lets take as an example number
    <br> which will not devide perfectly by 4
    <br> in this case just divide and process rest
    <br> part as is:
    <br> Deviding 101001 into 10 1001:
    <br> 10   - 2 in decimal - 2 in hex
    <br> 1001 - 9 in decimal - 9 in hex 
    <br> result: BIN(101001) = HEX(29)
    <br> 
    <br> another example
    <br> A1 in HEX
    <br> A = 10 in decimal = 1011 in bin
    <br> 1 = 1 in decimal = 1 in bin
    <br>  as in HEX numbers should be taken
    <br> from right side to the left with in 
    <br> interval of 4 symbols, we should 
    <br> consider this information when preparing 
    <br> our answer:
    <br> 10100001
