Number representation systems <br>
<br>
Any system has some base and every number that should <br>
be represented using some system has a weight <br>
the weight itself decriments by each step from the <br>
left to right side. <br>
<br>
Decimal system <br>
Decimal system represents number using 10 base <br>
number 123 in decimal system is 123 (1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10^1) <br>
<br>
Binary system <br>
Each number here can be represented as a sequence of bits <br>
123 in binary is 1111011 <br>
<br>
123/2 = 61.* -> has floating -> 1<br>
61/2  = 30.* -> has floating -> 1<br>
30/2  = 15.0 -> doesnt       -> 0<br>
15/2  = 7.*  -> has floating -> 1<br>
7/2   = 3.*  -> has floating -> 1<br>
3/2   = 1.*  -> has floating -> 1<br>
1/2   = 0.*  -> has floating -> 1<br>
<br>
1101111 -> reverse -> 1111011<br>
<br>
To convert back from binary to decimal:<br>
take binary itself 1111011<br>
assign weights<br>
w| 6 5 4 3 2 1 0<br>
n| 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 <br>
1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0<br>
  64  +  32   +   16  +   8   +   0   +   2   +   1<br>
-> 123<br>
