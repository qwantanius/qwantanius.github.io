    <br> Registors of processor
    <br> CPU which is Central Process Unit
    <br> built with arithmetic unit, controll unit
    <br> and register unit
    <br> register unit stores registers, some of them 
    <br> are general used, some of them special purpose
    <br> general used registore are just temporary holding
    <br> places for data manipulated by computation
    <br> OTHER DEFINITION:
    <br> General-purpose registers serve as temporary holding 
    <br> places for data being manipulated by the CPU. 
    <br> These registers hold the inputs to the arith-metic/logic 
    <br> units circuitry and provide storage space for results produced by
    <br> that unit.
