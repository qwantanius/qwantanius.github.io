<br>
AI program based on AlphaGo Zero algorithm <br>
developed by https://golden.com/wiki/DeepMind-DNKVR6 <br>
company. <br>
<br>
`<br>
AlphaGo Zero is a computer program utilizing artificial <br>
intelligence and machine learning techniques to play the game Go. <br>
AlphaGo Zero learned without using any domain specific <br>
knowledge from human experts. <br>
It started with random moves and learned through <br>
repeatedly playing against itself millions of times.<br>

<br>
The main idea of it, that it teaches itself how to play<br>
chess and go, knowing very base rules, while other world<br>
wide programm champions feeded with many handcrafted <br>
rules.<br>
